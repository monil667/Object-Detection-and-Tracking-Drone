# Object-detection-and-tracking-Drone
Object detection and tracking drones are advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify, track, and follow objects or subjects autonomously. 
These drones are used in a variety of applications including surveillance, search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, agricultural management, and more.

Key Components:

Drone Hardware:

Frame and Propulsion: The physical structure, motors, and propellers that enable flight.

Camera and Sensors: High-resolution cameras (RGB, thermal, or infrared), GPS, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), and other sensors for environmental awareness.

Processing Unit: Onboard computer or microcontroller to process data in real-time.

Software and Algorithms:

Object Detection: Uses algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), or Faster R-CNN (Region Convolutional Neural Network) to identify objects within the camera's field of view.

Object Tracking: Algorithms like Kalman Filters, Mean-Shift, and Particle Filters to follow the detected object over time.

Navigation and Control: Autonomous flight control systems for maneuvering and stability.
